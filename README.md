# Extracted Optifine
Optifine .JAR files already extracted because why is it not a thing by default? God, extracting those things for MultiMC instances is a pain.

## Contributing
You're free to send extracted JAR files as pull requests but do keep in mind I'll be checking their SHA-256 to check if it's the same as the extracted mod file on my end.
You know, to prevent dumb ratters.

You can request specific versions via issues whenever you wish and I'll add it.
